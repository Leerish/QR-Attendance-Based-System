This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installing dependencies

```bash
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Description

A web solution for tracking the progress of the club by creating time sheets for each individual project of the event conducted by the club.
The system utilizes Quick Response (QR) codes to streamline the attendance tracking process, making it efficient, accurate, and convenient for both administrators and attendees.

## How It Works

Generating QR Codes

: The system generates unique QR codes for each individual or participant. These QR codes contain relevant information such as user ID, name, and any other necessary data.

Attendance Recording

: When attendees arrive at a particular location or event, they present their QR codes to a designated scanner or smartphone app. The system scans the QR code, extracts the embedded information, and records the attendance of the individual in a database.

Real-time Data Processing

: The system processes the attendance data in real-time, updating the attendance records instantly. 

Reporting and Analytics

: The system generates comprehensive reports and analytics based on the attendance data.
